Welcome to the React TODO App, your assignment as a Frontend Developer Intern! In this project, you'll be creating an offline TODO App for the browser using React JS. This README will guide you through the task, key features required, and expectations.

## Task Description

Your task is to create a TODO application with the following features:

1. **Input Bar**: Provide a simple input bar where users can add TODO items by pressing the return key.

2. **TODO List**: Display a list of TODO cards. Each card should represent a TODO item and should be appended to the list when created.

3. **Mark as Complete**: Users should be able to mark a TODO item as complete by clicking on it. Once marked complete, the item should move to the bottom of the list.

4. **Sorting**: Active TODO cards should appear in the order of creation, with the most recent on top. Completed TODO cards should appear in the order of completion, with the most recent on top.

5. **Reset Button**: Include a reset button in the top right corner of the app. Clicking this button should clear all TODO items and return the app to its initial state.

6. **Offline Support**: Ensure that hitting the refresh button (including a hard refresh) in the browser does not cause any change in the state of the app. It should work like a regular offline app.
